              To every project we’ve had so far I have tried to design something different every time. It’s easy to fall into “habits” and personal preferences when we have to be creative on command repeatedly. Those habits can be personal color favorites, typography and a certain way to organize the website. All three website projects have very different layout overall, and design. This was intentional.

              Going back and trying to improve this project was the hardest one out of all three. Not because I got an A and therefore “its perfect duh”. I received valid feedback from tutor on several areas. But while I worked on this project I was very thorough with avoiding repeating styling in the css and keeping everything organized. It was also my first time styling the navigation menu this way with only css and html. And since it works the way it should - it’s not actually necessary to scratch it and add JavaScript instead. For practice purposes I have achieved a lot doing this on the other projects.

              I considered having a burger menu on the desktop to be a risk when designing this project. But I’m glad that the tutor understood the intention with this. For this portfolio assignment I added an additional class called “active”. Because while the menu was open it didn’t highlight what page the user was on.

          </div>
          <div class="text_column">
            <p>
              The menu typography is already bold. So the best way to emphasize what page they’re on is a clear color contrast. I gave this class the yellow contrast color that’s used throughout the entire website. So although I returned to this project after many months, the adjustments still fit the page and nobody would really notice.

              There were clearly quite a few minor details that slipped by first time working on this project. At this time I wasn’t very familiar with input tags or what the difference was between “name” and “id”. I updated this in the html in all the pages and removed the closing tag on the input. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="text_column">
            <p>
              To this day I still don’t understand how the obvious wrong indenting in the footer slipped by when I delivered this project. But this is now also fixed. Guess this kind of experience is somewhat relatable to everyone working with code.

              On a side note, I attempted to convert this project to sass instead of using plain CSS. I came to terms that it would just be easier to make the project again from scratch because it ended up being too much effort having to reorganize all the pictures and links. Everything that broke in this attempt made it overwhelming. In this situation I was very grateful for the branch system on github. So reverting the mistake was easy.
